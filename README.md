# GOL - Game of Life

This is a quick implementation of Conway's Game of Life using node.js.

## Running GOL

You can install GOL by running `npm install` and run it by entering `npm start` in the `gol` directory. (You can also run it with `node index.js`.)

## Usage

You will first be asked to enter the size of the playfield (for good results, enter width and height larger than 18).

Then the Game of Life will commence.
